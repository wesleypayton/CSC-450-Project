Team Members: Elijah Payton, Gregory Whitehurst
Description: CSC450 Project

Instructions on how to run:
Open CMD
Navigate to unzipped project folder
Run routing.py via python  	Ex. python routing.py topology-1.csv

Team Responsibilities:
Elijah Payton: 
I worked on the distance-vector function. I worked together with Greg to make the Dijkstra’s algorithm function. I handled the formatting of outputs for each function. We also split the commenting work for the program. We used a Github Repo to manage our work.


Gregory Whitehurst:
I handled the CSV input and got it to be the data type desired, since we thought it would be beneficial to represent the network topology as a dictionary of dictionaries. Dijkstra’s algorithm was a combined effort between Eli and I. We spent quite some time trying to debug that function in particular. I also implemented a small error check for if the user inputs a node that is not in the topology.
